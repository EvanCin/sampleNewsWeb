                                <p>
                                    A major portion of our lives is dedicated to work. We spend 5 out of 7 days every week at the office, hunched over screens and rustling through piles of papers. On some days, we even work overtime. As those hours stack on top of each other, at some point, the pile topples over. You become mentally and physically exhausted and cannot fathom heading to work again. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This is because our 48 hour weekends plainly do not provide enough time for us to recuperate. However, there is a solution. Four day work weeks. Companies should reduce work hours as it benefits the health of workers, leading to higher productivity and a motivated work environment. 
                                </p>
                                
                                <h3>Health and Stress</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The well-being of employees should be taken seriously as we work in hopes of improving our quality of life, not to degrade it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There have been reports released by companies around the world which indicate that working four days a week is effective. In particular, Iceland has found huge success with their trials. The experiment took place “between 2015 and 2019” with “2,500 workers who took part” (Ellerbeck). The aim was to reduce the stress levels at a service-center and at the “Reykjavik Child Protection Service” (Haraldsson p20). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The employees found themselves “more energised, and less stressed” because they were able to allot more time towards their hobbies and friends (41). This is due to the fact that for most people, the majority of their weekends are filled with chores such as cleaning and shopping. Furthermore, they have to set aside time for their families which takes up a large portion of their day. As a result, by having an extra day off, workers are able to better recuperate from the past week and be ready for the next.
                                </p>
                                <h4>Relation to Productivity</h4>
                                <p>
                                    This extra free time off proves to be worthwhile as it drastically improves the productivity of employees. A study done by John Pencavel, an economics professor at Stanford University shows that when people work long hours, it has a significant impact on their work speed. He wrote that “due to stress, fatigue, and other factors…overworked employees may simply be substantially less productive at all hours of the work day” (Pencavel). This proves that working longer does not equate to more work done at the same rate. A tired person works at a slower rate and is prone to mistakes. Essentially, this means employees should have less work hours. By doing so, they can head to the office at their optimal state so that even though they have less time, they are producing the same if not better quality work. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Although these are significant beneficial factors, there are some cons to the four day work weeks which need to be considered. 
                                </p>
                                <h3>Compatibility and the Need For Test Runs</h3>
                                <p>
                                    For one, this style is not applicable with some industries such as “emergency services, public transport networks and logistics” which require employees to work the full hours (Ellerbeck). This is because workers in, for example, the emergency services need to be at work on Fridays to ensure that people who need saving can get the help they need. On the contrary, with jobs such as web developers who can basically work whenever they want, this new schedule can be implemented into their company if they choose to do so. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This leads to questions regarding the general workflow. One might ask: How will my schedule be impacted? These questions ultimately differ from person to person with no fixed answer. However, “In interviews with workers in the Icelandic Government trial,” they stated that people were incentivized to “work more efficiently — with changes made to how meetings were run, as well as schedules”(Haraldsson p35). The reduced hours made employees think of ways to adapt to the situation and optimize their routine. Basically, it is a matter of whether you would be willing to rework your schedule around the new model and if you are able to adapt to it. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    There might be some hesitance with going forth with this plan because there is the question of: Is this schedule going to work for me? Am I going to like it? Is it going to be effective?
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Thats where the trials come into place. Like the experiments held by the Icelandic government above, companies can hold trials to observe the effects of the reduced work hours. If both the company and employees find the model effective, then it is worth considering applying it to the whole company. 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    As the global staffing company Manpower Group's Chairman and CEO Jonas Prising said, “The traditional nine-to-five, five-day working week ‘looks more old fashioned than a Ford Model T'”(Ellerbeck). 
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We are in the modern age where technology is rapidly advancing. Therefore, we should also match that growth in the career aspect by implementing the four day work week so that workers are given proper work-life balance to keep up with company demands. 
                                </p>
                                <br>
